          I'm Jiregna Worku, a 4th-year Software Engineering student at Injibara
          University. I specialize in creating visually appealing and
          user-friendly web and mobile applications. With a strong foundation in
          React, JavaScript, Node.js...., and modern UI/UX practices, I enjoy
          solving problems and building products that make a difference.

          My journey in tech began with curiosity and quickly grew into a
          passion for frontend development and Flutter Mobile App Development.
          I'm always eager to learn and improve, exploring the latest tools and
          technologies in the field.
